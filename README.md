Inspiration
Since this was all of our first time using Unity, we wanted to make a game that incorporated some sort of interesting mechanic and was relatively playable. Unfortunately, we couldn't get the latter, and using the controls is a challenge in itself. Nevertheless, we all had a lot of fun and still learned a lot about Unity.

What it does
The game consists of one level where the objective is to get the golf ball inside the black hole. You can use other planets' gravitational fields to propel and slingshot you even further. When the golf ball lands inside the black hole, it'll cause an explosion and destroy it.

How we built it
We built Galaxy Golf using Unity. The planets and asteroids were free assets found in the Unity asset store.
